Ryu Client for Pyretic
######################

This readme helps the user to run Pyretic modules and the Ryu-based of_client,
on top of a Mininet topology.

Quick-start: before running the scripts, you need to download the Pyretic's sources with command
	     "git clone https://github.com/frenetic-lang/pyretic.git"
	     
1) Start Mininet: ./mininetStart.sh
2) Start Pyretic: ./pyreticStart.sh ryu 

In step 2), use the "pox" argument if you want to use the POX of_client.
